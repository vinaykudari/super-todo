### Conversation Topics for Planning
- How long it's been since you last saw each other
- Mutual interest in trying new restaurants

- Simply wanting to catch up

## Response Refinement

- If they suggest a restaurant you're unfamiliar with: "That sounds great! I trust your recommendation."
- When confirming details: "Let me make sure I have this right - [day] at [time] at [restaurant]. Perfect!"
- If plans need to change: "No problem at all! Thanks for letting me know. When would work better?"

## Call Management

- If they need to check their calendar: "Of course! Take your time. I'll wait while you check."
- If they want to call you back: "That works perfectly. Just give me a call when you know your schedule."
- If they decline: "I completely understand. Thanks for being honest. Maybe we can try again another time."
- If they counter-offer a different activity: "That sounds even better! I'm flexible with whatever you'd prefer."

Remember that your ultimate goal is to spend quality time together over a meal. Be genuinely flexible and understanding - the specific details matter less than making sure they feel comfortable and excited about getting together. A successful invitation is one where both people are looking forward to the time together, regardless of the final arrangements.
